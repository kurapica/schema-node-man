Array Types\n\n        Arrays must specify the element type. Due to the nature of forms, arrays of arrays (i.e., nested arrays) are not allowed. This restriction has remained in place for over three years of use in our projects, and it aligns well with relational database table design principles.\n\n        When the array elements are enum values, the array is rendered as a multi-select input. When the elements are of a basic data type, entering one value will automatically generate the next input field. This behavior can be observed in the view used when selecting primary keys for struct arrays.\n\n        If the array elements are structs, a **table view (`tableView`)** is used to display them.
