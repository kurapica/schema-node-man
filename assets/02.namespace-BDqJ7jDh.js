Namespace\n\n        Namespaces are used to manage data types and avoid naming conflicts between types with the same name. Typically, namespaces can follow a structure like `organization.application.feature.type`.\n\n        You can try this by clicking "Add" in the type management section on the right and selecting the default namespace for your new type.\n\n        The system includes a built-in `system` namespace, which provides basic data types and commonly used functions.\n\n        In the configuration interface, you will also see a `schema` namespace. This namespace defines types used for type definitions themselvesâ€”for example, `schema.valuetype` can be used to select a type.\n\n        Both the `system` and `schema` namespaces are marked as system-level, so they cannot be modified. The `schema` namespace is reserved for internal use by this service, and its types should not be used directly.\n\n        It is recommended to use lowercase letters for namespace names whenever possible.\n    ')])),_:1}))}});export{p as default};
